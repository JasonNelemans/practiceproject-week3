Self assessment 

The practice project went not too bad. I surprised myself by finishing the (rough) functionality part of it in one go. I’m really satisfied I took the time to read through the entire project first and the followed along the project guide step by step, by taking the time to pen down the next step on paper first and then implementing it in with the code. Most important to me, was to get the code working. Style is virtually non-existent yet. 
I see I fetched the doctor’s data in two different components, I could have easily fetched it once in App.js and then passed it down to its child components using the render attribute in the Route method. 
At the patient signup form, I feel like I have used the state way too many times, once for each input handler. This is something I can perhaps take another look at and come up with a better solution to make the logic denser and compact. 
The sorting the patients with filter logic I used must have a more elegant and dynamic solution than the one I used. Now, with each new doctor, I will have to add a new else if statement. Also, the same with fetching the doctor names in the select option. I leave this as room for improvement in the clean up.
